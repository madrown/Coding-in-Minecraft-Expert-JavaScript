## Step 1 @unplugged

In coding, logic refers to the process of **developing a set of instructions or statements that govern how a computer program should operate**. It involves creating a series of rules, conditions, and actions that dictate what a program should do when it is executed.

The logic of a program typically involves the use of conditional statements. **Conditional statements**, also known as "if-statements," are used in coding to **make decisions based on certain conditions**. These statements work by checking if a specific condition is true or false, which is represented by a Boolean expression. Depending on whether the condition is true or false, different statements are executed in a specific order. 

## Step 2 @unplugged

In JavaScript you have a variety of conditional statements.  One of which is the **If Statement**.  
If Statements check to see if a condition is true or false and execute code depending on the result. 
Below is an example of an If statement that checks to see if the variable for playerAge is greater than or equal to 13.  If the condition is true, the player will say "You can play." 

    let playerAge =  13
    if  (playerAge >=  13)  {
	    player.say("You can play!")
	    }

Notice the indentation in the code above. In JavaScript, indentation is not required, however, we will be using it to indicate the structure and hierarchy of our code.  In the example above, we have indented the player.say portion of the if-statement so the we can better understand that portion of the code is what will run if the conditional is true. 

## Step 3 @unplugged

We use  **logic conditions** in JavaScript conditional statements. Here are some examples of these conditions. 
-   Equals:  a == b
-   Not Equals:  a != b
-   Less than:  a < b
-   Less than or equal to:  a <= b
-   Greater than:  a > b
-   Greater than or equal to:  a >= b

In our example below, you will see again that we used the condition of greater than or equal to. 

    let playerAge =  13
    if  (playerAge >=  13)  {
	    player.say("You can play!")
	    }

## Step 4

Now it is your turn to write an if statement.  Let's begin by declaring a variable score and assign it the value of 12. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let score = 5

```

## Step 5

Next, create an if statement that checks to see if the score is greater than or equal to 10. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let score = 12
if  (score >=  10)  {
	    
	    }
```

## Step 6

Add to the if statement that the player will say, "You win!" if the conditional is true. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let score =  10
if  (score >=  12)  {
	 player.say("You win!")
	    }
```

## Step 7

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 8 @ unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You will know your code is correct when you see the text "You win!" appear on your screen.
  

## Step 9
When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
