# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 1.1.8
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

In this activity, you are going to practice creating variables for your code.  First, create 3 variables.  The first will be for playerAge and have a number value of 10. The second will be for score and the value equals 0. The third will be playerName and set to the string Alex. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let playerAge = 10
let score = 0
let playerName = "Alex"

```

## Step 2

Next, add to the code by creating a variable called extraPoint and assign it the value of 1.  Then use the athematic operator to create a variable called finalScore that adds the score and the extraPoint. And have the player say the finalScore. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let playerAge = 10
let score = 0
let playerName = "Alex"
let extraPoint = 1
let finalScore = score + extraPoint
player.say(finalScore)
```

## Step 3

Add to your previous code and create a variable message that uses the format string method to say this sentence when it is run "Our playerAlex is 10 and has the final score of 1." 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let playerAge = 10
let score = 0
let playerName = "Alex"
let extraPoint = 1
let finalScore = score + extraPoint
player.say(finalScore)
let message =  "Our player ${playerName} is ${playerAge} and has the final score of ${finalScore}.` 

```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.
