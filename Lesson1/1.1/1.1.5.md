## Step 1

You can perform various operations on string variables, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting. **Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string.** In JavaScript, you can use the "+" operator to concatenate strings. Let's create a code that uses concatenation to combine 2 variables. 
First, create a variable with the name firstName and assign it the value of your first name. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"

```

## Step 2
Next, create a variable with the name lastName and assign it the value of your last name. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"
    let lastName = "Brown"
 
```


## Step 3

Create a variable called fullName and use a concatenation string to concantenate your first name and your last name with a space in the middle. (Note... for the space, use " " as the string. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"
    let lastName = "Brown"
    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName 
  
```

## Step 4

Lastly, have the player say your first and last name using the + operator for the variable playerName. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"
    let lastName = "Brown"
    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName 
    player.say(fullName)
```

## Step 5 @ unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see your full name appear on your screen. 

## Step 6

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
