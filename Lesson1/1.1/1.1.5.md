## Step 1

You can perform various operations on string variables, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting. **Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string.** In JavaScript, you can use the "+" operator to concatenate strings. Let's create a code that uses concatenation to combine 2 variables. 
First, create a variable with the name firstName and assign it the value of your first name. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"

```

## Step 2
Next, create a variable with the name lastName and assign it the value of your last name. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"
    let lastName = "Brown"
 
```


## Step 3

Create a variable called fullName and use a concatenation string to concantenate your first name and your last name with a space in the middle. (Note... for the space, use " " as the string. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"
    let lastName = "Brown"
    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName 
  
```

## Step 4

Lastly, have the player say your first and last name using the + operator for the variable playerName. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let firstName = "Jennifer"
    let lastName = "Brown"
    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName 
    player.say(fullName)
```

## Step 5

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see your full name appear on your screen. 

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
