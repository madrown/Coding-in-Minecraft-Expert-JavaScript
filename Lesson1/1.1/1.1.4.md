## Step 1 @unplugged
In JavaScript, a string is a **sequence of characters enclosed in quotes** (either single or double quotes). Strings are a common type of data used in programming, especially for text-based applications.
 String Variables are a fundamental part of JavaScript programming, and understanding how to work with them is essential for many applications. 
 To create a string variable in JavaScript, you simply **assign a string value to a variable name.**
 For example:

    let playerName = "Steve"
    player.say(playerName)

## Step 2

Let's practice creating string variables.  
Declare a variable for playerName with your name as the string.

Next, Have the player say the playerName.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
playerName = "Jennifer"
player.say(playerName)

```

You will know your code is correct when you see your name appear on your screen. 

## Step 5

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
