## Step 1
In JavaScript, a string is a **sequence of characters enclosed in quotes** (either single or double quotes). Strings are a common type of data used in programming, especially for text-based applications.
 String Variables are a fundamental part of JavaScript programming, and understanding how to work with them is essential for many applications. 
 To create a string variable in JavaScript, you simply **assign a string value to a variable name.**
 For example:

    let playerName = "Steve"
    player.say(playerName)

## Step 2

Let's practice creating string variables.  
Declare a variable for playerName with your name as the string.

playerName = "Jennifer"

## Step 3

Next, Have the player say the playerName.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
playerName = "Jennifer"
player.say(playerName)

```

You will know your code is correct when you see your name appear on your screen. 

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
