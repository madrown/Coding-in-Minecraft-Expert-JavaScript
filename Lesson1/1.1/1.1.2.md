## Step 1

You can perform various operations with number variables such as arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and more. **Arithmetic operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (/) (remainder).**
Let's build a code using the addition operator. 
First, declare a variable named score and assign it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let score = 0

```

## Step 2
Now create a variable called playerScore and assign it the value of 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let score = 0
    let playerScore = 1

```

## Step 3
Next create a variable called finalScore that adds the gamePoint variable and extraPoint variable. Have the player say the finalScore.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let score = 0
    let playerScore = 1
    let finalScore = score + playerScore
  
```

## Step 4
Finally have the player say the finalScore. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
    let score = 0
    let playerScore = 1
    let finalScore = score + playerScore
    player.say(finalScore)
```

## Step 5
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen. 

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
