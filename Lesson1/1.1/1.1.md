## Step 1 @unplugged

In JavaScript, a variable is a name that represents a **value**. You can think of it as a container that holds a specific piece of data. Variables can hold many types of data, such as: numbers, strings (text), booleans, and more. To create variables in JavaScript, first you need to **declare the variable.** In MakeCode, we use the the word **let** to declare the variable.  Then you need to   **give the variable a name.** 

When naming variables, you need to keep the following in mind.

 - Variables can only start with a **letter, a dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_).** 
 - Variables are **case sensitive** (ex: if you capitalize a letter, you must capitalize it every time you use that variable)
 - Variables can only have **numbers, letters, the dollar sign, and the underscore character.**
 - Your variable should be named something that **reflects what your variable represents.** 
 - JavaScript keywords **cannot** be used as a variable name. 

After giving the variable a name you must **assign a value to it using the "=" operator.**
For example:

    let playerage = 13

## Step 2
For our variable activities, we will have use the code **say(message)** to make the player say the message and it will appear on your screen. The code to make your player say the message is below. 


    player.say(message)



## Step 3
Let's create a **number variable** for the number of lives a player starts with in and have the player say the number of lives. 
A number variable is used to represent numeric values such as integers, decimals, and fractions. Number variables are a common type of data used in programming, especially for calculating numbers. To create an number variable in JavaScript, you assign a number to a variable name using the = sign.

Below, declare the variable gameLives and assign it the value of 5. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

let gameLives = 5

```


## Step 4
Next, add the code to have the player say the variable gameLives. 
       
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript

let gameLives = 5
player.say(gameLives)

```

## Step 5 @unplugged
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 5 appear on your screen. 



## Step 6
If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
