# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 1.1.7

## Step 1
A Boolean variable in JavaScript is a variable that can only hold one of two values: **'True' or 'False'.** These values are used to represent the logical concepts of true and false, respectively. Boolean Variables are often used in control statements such as 'if' statements, 'while' loops, and 'for' loops to **make decisions based on whether a condition is true or false.** 

For example, the following code used a Boolean variable 'is_raining' to decide whether or not to bring an umbrella. 

    let is_raining =  true
    if  (is_raining)  {
	    player.say("It's raining. You should bring an umbrella.")
	}  else  {
		player.say("It's not raining. You don't need an umbrella.")
		}

The code above would result in the player saying "It's raining. You should bring an umbrella." This is because the variable is_raining is set to true. 

Boolean variables can also be combined using logical operator such as 'and', 'or;, and 'not' to create more complex conditions. We will look at these down the line.

## Step 2

In the space below, we have started the code for you to create a Boolean variable that tests for sunlight.  Complete the code to say If sunny weather is true, the player will say 'What a nice day' else the player will say 'Let's stay inside today.'
```template
    let is_sunny =  
    if  ()  {
	    player.say("")
	}  else  {
		player.say("")
		}
```

```javascript
    let is_sunny =  true
    if  (is_sunny)  {
	    player.say("What a nice day")
	}  else  {
		player.say("Let's stay inside today")
		}
```

## Step 3
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text "What a nice day" appear on your screen. 

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.

Now that you have learned about variables, continue to the next NPC to practice using them in code.
