## Step 1

Formatting strings in JavaScript means **creating a new string that includes variables, constants or expressions in a specific format.** This is often used to display information to the user in a more readable way, or to construct complex strings by combining different pieces of information.

In JavaScript, we can format strings using template literals. A template literal is a **string enclosed in backticks (  ) that can contain placeholders for variables, constants or expressions using the '${}' syntax.**
Look at the code below and predict what the player will say then run the code to check to see if your prediction was correct. 


    let name = "John"
    let age = 16 
    let message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`  
    player.say(message)


## Step 2

You should have predicted that the player would say 'My name is John and I am 16 years old.'
Now you write code that uses the '${}' syntax and it formats a string that combines the variables of playerName and playerScore and has the player say the string you created. 
First, declare a variable called playerName and assign it the value of Jennifer. Then declare a variable with the name playerScore with the value of 10.

```javascript
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
 
   
```

## Step 3
Next, declare a variable named message and give it the value of the sentence "My name is playerName and my score is playerScore" where the variable names are in the ${} syntax. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
   let message = `My name is ${playerName} and my score is ${playerScore}.`  
  
   
```

## Step 4
Lastly, have the player say the message. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
   let message = `My name is ${playerName} and my score is ${playerScore}.`  
   player.say(message)
   
```

## Step 5
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the sentence 'My name is Jennifer and my score is 10. 

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
