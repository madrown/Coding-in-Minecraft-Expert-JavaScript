## Step 1 @unplugged

Formatting strings in JavaScript means **creating a new string that includes variables, constants or expressions in a specific format.** This is often used to display information to the user in a more readable way, or to construct complex strings by combining different pieces of information.

In JavaScript, we can format strings using template literals. A template literal is a **string enclosed in backticks (  ) that can contain placeholders for variables, constants or expressions using the '${}' syntax.**
Look at the code below and predict what the player will say then run the code to check to see if your prediction was correct. 


    let name = "John"
    let age = 16 
    let message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`  
    player.say(message)


## Step 2

You should have predicted that the player would say 'My name is John and I am 16 years old.'
Now you write code that uses the '${}' syntax and it formats a string that combines the variables of playerName and playerScore and has the player say the string you created. 
First, declare a variable called playerName and assign it the value of Jennifer. Then declare a variable with the name playerScore with the value of 10.

```javascript
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
 
   
```

## Step 3
Next, declare a variable named message and give it the value of the sentence "My name is playerName and my score is playerScore" where the variable names are in the ${} syntax. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
   let message = `My name is ${playerName} and my score is ${playerScore}.`  
  
   
```

## Step 4
Lastly, have the player say the message. 

  #### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
   let playerName = "Jennifer"
   let playerScore = 10
   let message = `My name is ${playerName} and my score is ${playerScore}.`  
   player.say(message)
   
```

## Step 5 @unplugged
Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the sentence 'My name is Jennifer and my score is 10. 


## Step 6

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity. 

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
